# Tetris Project

During my CSCI 282 course, I embarked on an independent project to develop a classic Tetris game using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Java. Over the course of four months, I dedicated myself to implementing core Java functionalities to create a feature-rich gameplay experience.

## Key Features:
